                      <a href="#0">Airbnb</a> is an American San Francisco-based
                      company operating an online marketplace for short- and
                      long-term homestays and experiences. The company acts as a
                      broker and charges a commission from each booking. The
                      company was founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Nathan
                      Blecharczyk, and Joe Gebbia. Airbnb is a shortened version
                      of its original name, AirBedandBreakfast.com. Airbnb is
                      the most well-known company for short-term housing
                      rentals.

                      for stricter regulations on short-term home rental and in
                      addition to government-imposed restrictions, many
                      homeowner associations also limit short term rentals.

                    <h2>Why do Airbnb need web governance policies?</h2>
                    <p>Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO at Airbnb:</p>
                    <p>
                      Through spending twenty years working with hots, Airbnb
                      reflected that a lack of governance policy is a systemic
                      issue with most short rentals. Without web governance,
                      hosts usually experience a lack of process and
                      accountability leading to:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        An organic sprawl of content, creating bloated websites
                      </li>
                      <li>Inconsistent, poorer quality content</li>
                      <li>
                        Weak user experience impacting the ability to support
                        digital goals
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                      When these problems become acute enough, large website
                      redesign projects begin. But{' '}
                      <strong>
                        without governance being put in place at the same time,
                        the same problem will only happen again
                      </strong>
                      . Airbnb mitigate this risk by baking web governance into
                      their working process with clients from strategy through
                      to site launch and beyond.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Good governance leads to stronger results</h2>
                    <p>
                      With a strong process for content governance, the benefits
                      are clear for both Airbnb as a company and their clients.
                      Since its founding in 2008, Airbnb has become one of the
                      most successful and valuable start-ups in the world, and
                      has had a significant impact on the industry of renting
                      homes and the hospitality industry more generally.

                    <p>
                      Airbnb has also had a significant impact on the
                      hospitality industry, particularly in the area of hotels
                      and other traditional accommodation providers, which are
                      often referred to as the HORECA industry. Some industry
                      experts believe that Airbnb's rapid growth has disrupted
                      the traditional HORECA model, and has led to a decline in
                      revenue and occupancy rates for traditional hotels in
                      certain markets.

                    <p>
                      Mike reflected that the optimum time to introduce a web
                      governance policy is during a website relaunch project
                      because of the collective energy focused on creating a
                      better user experience. Voltaire recommends starting
                      governance policy in line with strategy kick-off.
