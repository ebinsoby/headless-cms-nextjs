                    We came together over a shared excitement about building a
                    product that could solve our own problem of where our next
                    favourite hack is coming from. But also a product that helps
                    everyone thrive in this market: from founders and engineers

                    We all thrive on learning something new every day and
                    everyone is constantly trying on different hats. We are
                    working with new technologies while rethinking an old
                    industry and are excited about all the possibilities and
                    opportunities to innovate. It's a problem deeply ingrained
